        <p> I like video games cuase they are the only things i do in my free time other than homework and watching TV but they are the most fun and inspring things to me, in fact they were what inspired me to do game designing and to white hat to learn to code and put that to making my actual dream come true. Actually the first thing i wanted to do was be a director but that didnt work out for me, so i wanted to move on to animating also didn't work out for me, so now i am at where i am at now Video game designing and playing video games, This is the farthest i have ever made it so i hope in the near future i become a profestional game designer and gamer but i already am a epicest gamer so it can't get better than that. </p>

        <p>Ubisoft is a great company, they make amzing games and are a huge team of dedicated workers and they are one of my inspirations. They made games such as assins creed vallhala and other games I can't recall as if now. I have put links to their website to buy their games if you want to, and info about their company I belive.</p>
